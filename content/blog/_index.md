  This blog will talk about bioinformatics, data analysis, and programming (mostly), with some general musings about workflow for research scientists. I'll try to provide helpful code snippets for specific tasks that you might encounter as a data analyst, programmer, or researcher."

** No content below YAML for the blog _index. This file provides front matter for the listing page layout and sidebar content. It is also a branch bundle, and all settings under `cascade` provide front matter for all pages inside blog/. You may still override any of these by changing them in a page's front matter.**
