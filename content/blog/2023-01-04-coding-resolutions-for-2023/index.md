So it's a new year and I spent some time thinking about what (data-science related things) I'd like to prioritize for the next 12 months!

These are my resolutions for 2023:

- *Cultivate my digital garden*. Too often, I finish a task that I've been struggling with and let it fade from my memory before writing an account of what was confusing and how I solved any issues.

- *Start using typescript* across my web dev projects. I've been learning TS for months, but haven't spend enough time building with it to feel confident about converting existing codebases.

- *Get more comfortable with web layout and CSS*. I always feel like I'm wasting too much time on design, without a clear picture of what I'm trying to achieve.

- Finish reading *Elements of Statistical Learning*
