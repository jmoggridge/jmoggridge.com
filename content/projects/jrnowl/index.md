If you have ever submitted an article for publication before, you know what an absolute hassle it can be. Our mission with [**jrnowl**](https://jrnowl.com) is to provide you with tools that make it fast and easy to prepare your manuscript and other requirements. 

Jrnowl's [**submission Guidelines Dashboard**](https://www.jrnowl.com/dashboard) allows you to find the submission requirements for many medical journals, with filters that narrow down the search for an appropriate journal for your work. 

[**Rate-A-Journal**](https://www.jrnowl.com/RAJ) is our social platform for journal ratings. Share your best and worst experiences in academic publishing, roast journals that wasted your time, and toast those who made the process effortless! Help us shine some light on current practices in academic publishing.

**Jrnowl** is a web-app created by Michael Fralick, Tamara Van Bakel, and Jason Moggridge. We'd love to hear any feedback that you might have.
