# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->

My work as a data scientist mostly involves data management, analysis, and reporting. This is my dream job because I love creating models, plots, parameterized reports, websites, and interactive apps. I use R for most of my data science work, but recently I've been learning Javascript, React, and Next-JS to get better at web development. I'm passionate about coding, automating repetitive tasks, and creating reproducible research.
